# Internal Documentation

This folder contains internal documentation that is **not intended for public consumption**. These documents are for development, planning, and internal use only.

## Contents

- **`layout/`** - Internal module structure audits, recommendations, and migration roadmaps
- **`testing/`** - Internal test coverage documentation
- **`saas/`** - SaaS implementation guides, requirements, and pricing strategies (partner-only)
- **`migration/`** - Internal migration guides for breaking changes
- **`documentation-upgrade-plan.md`** - Internal planning document for documentation improvements
- **`GITBOOK.md`** - GitBook setup instructions for maintainers

## Purpose

These documents are kept in the repository for:
- Historical reference
- Internal team coordination
- Development planning
- Partner/enterprise documentation

They should **not** be included in public documentation builds or linked from public-facing documentation.

## Excluding from Public Builds

If using GitBook or similar documentation tools, configure them to exclude the `.internal/` folder from public builds.
