## Executive Summary

### The Opportunity

TrustWeave SaaS is a **multi-domain, no-code platform** that enables organizations across any industry to issue and manage verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers (DIDs) without writing code. We're building the **"Shopify for Verifiable Credentials"** — a platform where anyone can create, share, and use credential templates across unlimited domains.

### The Problem

**Current State:**
- Verifiable credential issuance requires deep technical expertise
- Existing platforms are domain-specific or require coding
- No unified template marketplace for credentials
- Limited no-code solutions for SSI/DID infrastructure
- High barriers to entry for non-technical users

**Market Pain Points:**
- Universities spend $50-200 per credential verification
- Healthcare organizations struggle with license verification
- Financial institutions need KYC/AML compliance solutions
- Supply chains require tamper-proof certifications
- Government agencies need digital identity infrastructure

### The Solution

**TrustWeave SaaS Platform:**
- ✅ **No-Code First**: Visual builders for credentials and DIDs
- ✅ **Template Marketplace**: Pre-built and custom templates for any domain
- ✅ **Multi-Domain**: Education, Healthcare, Finance, Supply Chain, Government, etc.
