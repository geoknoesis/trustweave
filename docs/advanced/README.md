# Advanced Topics

Dive deeper into VeriCore with focused guides on key rotation, verification policies, SPI extensions, testing, and performance. Start with:

- [Key Rotation](key-rotation.md)
- [Verification Policies](verification-policies.md)

Additional pages (SPI, adapters, testing, performance) will expand over time as we codify best practices. Contributions welcome—see the [Contributing Guide](../contributing/README.md).
