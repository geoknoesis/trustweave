# Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

> VeriCore is created and supported by [Geoknoesis LLC](https://www.geoknoesis.com). The project reflects Geoknoesis’ reference architecture for decentralized trust.

## What is a DID?

A **Decentralized Identifier (DID)** is a self-sovereign identifier controlled by its subject. It follows the `did:method:identifier` pattern—for example:

```
did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK
did:web:example.com:user:alice
did:ion:EiClkZMDnmYGhX8tR8i3z2b5M5fN5hJ5vK5xL5yM5zN5oP5q
```

Resolving a DID yields a **DID Document**, a JSON-LD structure listing public keys, services, and capabilities that prove control of the identifier. VeriCore serialises these documents using Kotlinx Serialization so they remain strongly typed.

## Why DIDs matter in VeriCore

- **Identity anchor** – issuers, holders, verifiers, and services use DIDs as their canonical identifier during credential issuance and verification.
- **Portability** – you can switch DID methods (key, web, Ion, etc.) without rewriting business logic; only the registry wiring changes.
- **Foundation for proofs** – verifier flows fetch DID documents to validate signatures created during issuance (see the [Architecture Overview](../introduction/architecture-overview.md)).

## How VeriCore models DIDs

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `DidMethod` | Contracts `createDid`, `resolveDid`, `updateDid`, `deactivateDid` for a particular DID method implementation. |
| `DidMethodRegistry` | Context-scoped registry that decides which methods are available to the current `VeriCoreConfig`. |
| `DidCreationOptions` | Typed builder for method-specific parameters (algorithm, domain, custom properties). |

Wallets expose DID helpers through the `DidManagement` capability (see the [Wallet API Reference](../api-reference/wallet-api.md#didmanagement)).

### Example: Registering and using DID methods

```kotlin
import com.geoknoesis.vericore.did.*
import com.geoknoesis.vericore.waltid.WaltIdIntegration

val didRegistry = DidMethodRegistry().apply {
    register(DidKeyMockMethod(kms))             // in-memory test method
    WaltIdIntegration.discoverAndRegister(this) // SPI discovery for did:key / did:web
}

val issuerDid = didRegistry.get("key")
    ?.createDid(
        didCreationOptions {
            algorithm = DidCreationOptions.KeyAlgorithm.ED25519
            property("label", "issuer-root")
        }
    )
    ?.id ?: error("did:key not registered")

println("Issuer DID: $issuerDid")
```

### DID documents at a glance

A DID document generated by VeriCore includes:

- `verificationMethod` entries referencing public keys (JWK or multibase).
- Usage relationships (`authentication`, `assertionMethod`, `keyAgreement`).
- Optional `service` endpoints and metadata fields (`created`, `updated`, `versionId`) for provenance tracking.

## Practical usage tips

- **Context-local registries** – create registries inside your `VeriCoreConfig` to avoid global state and to simplify tests.
- **SPI discovery** – ship new methods by implementing `DidMethodProvider`; VeriCore will auto-register them when the module is on the classpath.
- **Wallet DSL** – expose DID creation to end-users through `wallet { did { ... } }` (powered by `DidManagement`). See [Wallets](wallets.md#how-vericore-handles-wallet-dids).
- **Verification** – ensure hosted DID documents or Universal Resolver endpoints are reachable from verifier environments to guarantee proof validation succeeds.

# Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

> VeriCore is developed by [Geoknoesis LLC](https://www.geoknoesis.com). The content below reflects Geoknoesis’ recommended best practices for decentralized identity.

## What is a DID?

A **Decentralized Identifier (DID)** is a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID refers to any subject (person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) as determined by the controller of the DID.

## DID Format

A DID consists of three parts:

```
did:method:identifier
```

- **`did:`** - The scheme identifier
- **`method:`** - The DID method (e.g., `key`, `web`, `ion`)
- **`identifier:`** - The method-specific identifier

### Examples

```
did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK
did:web:example.com:user:alice
did:ion:EiClkZMDnmYGhX8tR8i3z2b5M5fN5hJ5vK5xL5yM5zN5oP5q
```

## DID Document

A **DID Document** is a JSON-LD document that describes how to use a DID. It contains:

- **@context**: JSON-LD context(s) for semantic interpretation (defaults to W3C DID Core context)
- **Verification Methods**: Public keys for authentication and signing
- **Service Endpoints**: URLs for interacting with the DID
- **Authentication**: Methods for proving control of the DID
- **Assertion Method**: Methods for signing verifiable credentials
- **Key Agreement**: Methods for establishing secure channels
- **Capability Invocation**: Methods for invoking capabilities on behalf of the DID
- **Capability Delegation**: Methods for delegating capabilities to other DIDs

### Example DID Document

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"],
  "id": "did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK",
  "verificationMethod": [{
    "id": "did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK#keys-1",
    "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
    "controller": "did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK",
    "publicKeyMultibase": "z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK"
  }],
  "authentication": ["#keys-1"],
  "assertionMethod": ["#keys-1"],
  "capabilityInvocation": ["#keys-1"],
  "capabilityDelegation": ["#keys-1"]
}
```

### DID Document Metadata

When resolving a DID, the resolution result includes metadata about the DID Document:

- **created**: Timestamp when the DID document was created
- **updated**: Timestamp when the DID document was last updated
- **versionId**: Version identifier for the DID document
- **nextUpdate**: Timestamp indicating when to check for updates
- **canonicalId**: Canonical form of the DID identifier
- **equivalentId**: List of equivalent DID identifiers

## DID Methods

Different DID methods use different mechanisms for creating and resolving DIDs:

- **`did:key`**: Simple, self-contained DIDs based on public keys
- **`did:web`**: DIDs resolved via HTTPS from a domain
- **`did:ion`**: Microsoft's ION method using Bitcoin
- **`did:polygonid`**: Polygon-based DIDs
- **`did:indy`**: Hyperledger Indy DIDs

## Using DIDs in VeriCore

### Creating a DID

```kotlin
import com.geoknoesis.vericore.did.DidMethodRegistry
import com.geoknoesis.vericore.did.DidMethod

// Register a DID method
val didMethod: DidMethod = // ... get DID method
val didRegistry = DidMethodRegistry().apply { register(didMethod) }

// Create a DID
val didDocument = didRegistry.resolve("did:key:...")
val did = didDocument.id
```

### Resolving a DID

```kotlin
// Resolve a DID to its DID Document
val didRegistry = DidMethodRegistry()
val result = didRegistry.resolve("did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK")
val document = result.document

// Access verification methods
val verificationMethod = document.verificationMethod.first()
```

### Updating a DID Document

```kotlin
// Update a DID Document
val didRegistry = DidMethodRegistry()
val updated = didRegistry.resolve("did:key:...").let { result ->
    val method = didRegistry.get("key")!!
    method.updateDid(result.document.id) { current ->
        current.copy(
            service = current.service + Service(
                id = "#service-1",
                type = "LinkedDomains",
                serviceEndpoint = "https://example.com"
            )
        )
    }
}
```

## Benefits of DIDs

1. **Self-Sovereign**: You control your own identity
2. **Portable**: Not tied to any single provider
3. **Privacy-Preserving**: You choose what to reveal
4. **Cryptographically Verifiable**: Proof of ownership
5. **Decentralized**: No central authority required

## Common Use Cases

- **Identity Verification**: Prove who you are without revealing personal data
- **Credential Issuance**: Receive credentials tied to your DID
- **Authentication**: Sign in to services using your DID
- **Decentralized Applications**: Use DIDs in dApps
