# Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

> VeriCore is created and supported by [Geoknoesis LLC](https://www.geoknoesis.com). The project reflects Geoknoesis’ reference architecture for decentralized trust.

## What is a DID?

A **Decentralized Identifier (DID)** is a self-sovereign identifier controlled by its subject. It follows the `did:method:identifier` pattern—for example:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.geoknoesis.vericore:vericore-did:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT")
    implementation("com.geoknoesis.vericore:vericore-core:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

**Result:** Pulls the DID registry, builders, and data models into your project so the examples below compile.

```
did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK
did:web:example.com:user:alice
did:ion:EiClkZMDnmYGhX8tR8i3z2b5M5fN5hJ5vK5xL5yM5zN5oP5q
```

Resolving a DID yields a **DID Document**, a JSON-LD structure listing public keys, services, and capabilities that prove control of the identifier. VeriCore serialises these documents using Kotlinx Serialization so they remain strongly typed.

## Why DIDs matter in VeriCore

- **Identity anchor** – issuers, holders, verifiers, and services use DIDs as their canonical identifier during credential issuance and verification.
- **Portability** – you can switch DID methods (key, web, Ion, etc.) without rewriting business logic; only the registry wiring changes.
- **Foundation for proofs** – verifier flows fetch DID documents to validate signatures created during issuance (see the [Architecture Overview](../introduction/architecture-overview.md)).

## How VeriCore models DIDs

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `DidMethod` | Contracts `createDid`, `resolveDid`, `updateDid`, `deactivateDid` for a particular DID method implementation. |
| `DidMethodRegistry` | Context-scoped registry that decides which methods are available to the current `VeriCoreConfig`. |
| `DidCreationOptions` | Typed builder for method-specific parameters (algorithm, domain, custom properties). |

Wallets expose DID helpers through the `DidManagement` capability (see the [Wallet API Reference](../api-reference/wallet-api.md#didmanagement)).

### Example: Registering and using DID methods

```kotlin
import com.geoknoesis.vericore.did.*
import com.geoknoesis.vericore.waltid.WaltIdIntegration

val didRegistry = DidMethodRegistry().apply {
    register(DidKeyMockMethod(kms))             // in-memory test method
    WaltIdIntegration.discoverAndRegister(this) // SPI discovery for did:key / did:web (see [walt.id Integration](../integrations/waltid.md))
}

val issuerDid = didRegistry.get("key")
    ?.createDid(
        didCreationOptions {
            algorithm = DidCreationOptions.KeyAlgorithm.ED25519
            property("label", "issuer-root")
        }
    )
    ?.id ?: error("did:key not registered")

println("Issuer DID: $issuerDid")

**Outcome:** Registers test and SPI-discovered DID methods, creates a new DID using typed options, and returns its identifier for use in issuance flows.
```

### DID documents at a glance

A DID document generated by VeriCore includes:

- `verificationMethod` entries referencing public keys (JWK or multibase).
- Usage relationships (`authentication`, `assertionMethod`, `keyAgreement`).
- Optional `service` endpoints and metadata fields (`created`, `updated`, `versionId`) for provenance tracking.

## Practical usage tips

- **Context-local registries** – create registries inside your `VeriCoreConfig` to avoid global state and to simplify tests.
- **SPI discovery** – ship new methods by implementing `DidMethodProvider`; VeriCore will auto-register them when the module is on the classpath.
- **Wallet DSL** – expose DID creation to end-users through `wallet { did { ... } }` (powered by `DidManagement`). See [Wallets](wallets.md#how-vericore-handles-wallet-dids).
- **Verification** – ensure hosted DID documents or Universal Resolver endpoints are reachable from verifier environments to guarantee proof validation succeeds.
- **Error handling** – all DID operations return `Result<T>` with structured `VeriCoreError` types. See [Error Handling](../advanced/error-handling.md).
- **Input validation** – VeriCore automatically validates DID format and method registration before operations.
