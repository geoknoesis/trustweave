# How-To Guides

Welcome to TrustWeave's How-To Guides! These guides are **task-oriented** and show you how to accomplish specific goals with TrustWeave.

## What are How-To Guides?

How-To Guides are practical, step-by-step instructions for completing specific tasks. They differ from:

- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step learning experiences that teach concepts while building something
- **Concepts**: Explanations of what things are and why they exist
- **API Reference**: Complete documentation of all methods and parameters

## How to Use These Guides

1. **Find the task you want to accomplish** - Browse the guides below or use search
2. **Follow the step-by-step instructions** - Each guide includes complete, runnable examples
3. **Adapt to your needs** - Use the examples as starting points for your own code
4. **Refer to API Reference** - For detailed parameter documentation, see the [API Reference](../api-reference/README.md)
