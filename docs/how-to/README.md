# How-To Guides

Welcome to TrustWeave's How-To Guides! These guides are **task-oriented** and show you how to accomplish specific goals with TrustWeave.

## What are How-To Guides?

How-To Guides are practical, step-by-step instructions for completing specific tasks. They differ from:

- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step learning experiences that teach concepts while building something
- **Concepts**: Explanations of what things are and why they exist
- **API Reference**: Complete documentation of all methods and parameters

## How to Use These Guides

1. **Find the task you want to accomplish** - Browse the guides below or use search
2. **Follow the step-by-step instructions** - Each guide includes complete, runnable examples
3. **Adapt to your needs** - Use the examples as starting points for your own code
4. **Refer to API Reference** - For detailed parameter documentation, see the [API Reference](../api-reference/README.md)

## Available Guides

### Core Tasks

These guides cover the essential operations you'll use in most TrustWeave applications:

- **[Use TrustWeave Facade](use-trustweave-facade.md)** - Quick setup with sensible defaults (start here!)
- **[Configure TrustWeave](configure-trustlayer.md)** - Declarative DSL configuration
- **[Create and Manage DIDs](create-dids.md)** - Create, resolve, update, and deactivate DIDs
- **[Issue Credentials](issue-credentials.md)** - Issue verifiable credentials with proofs
- **[Verify Credentials](verify-credentials.md)** - Verify credentials and check validity
- **[Manage Wallets](manage-wallets.md)** - Store, organize, and present credentials
- **[Anchor to Blockchain](blockchain-anchoring.md)** - Anchor data for tamper evidence
- **[Multi-Chain Anchoring](multi-chain-anchoring.md)** - Anchor to multiple blockchains for redundancy
- **[Exchange Credentials](exchange-credentials.md)** - Exchange credentials using multiple protocols (DIDComm, OIDC4VCI, CHAPI)
- **[Handle Errors](../advanced/error-handling.md)** - Error handling patterns and best practices

### Advanced Tasks

For more complex scenarios and customization:

- **[Rotate Keys](../advanced/key-rotation.md)** - Rotate cryptographic keys while preserving credential history
- **[Configure Verification Policies](../advanced/verification-policies.md)** - Customize verification behavior
- **[Build Custom Adapters](../advanced/custom-adapters.md)** - Create custom implementations
- **[Implement SPI Plugins](../advanced/spi.md)** - Build pluggable components
- **[Optimize Performance](../advanced/performance.md)** - Performance tuning and best practices

### Integration Guides

1. **Prerequisites** - What you need before starting
2. **Expected Outcome** - What you'll achieve
3. **Quick Example** - A complete, runnable example you can copy and run
4. **Step-by-Step Guide** - Detailed instructions with step markers and code at each step
5. **Common Patterns** - Real-world usage patterns
6. **Error Handling** - How to handle errors for this task
7. **Next Steps** - What to learn next
8. **Related Resources** - Links to concepts, API reference, and scenarios

**Note:** Guides include code snippets at the right steps (not dumped at the end), and workflow diagrams where multiple components interact.
