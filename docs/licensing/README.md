# Licensing Overview

TrustWeave is distributed under a dual-license model managed by [Geoknoesis LLC](https://www.geoknoesis.com). This structure keeps the toolkit accessible for learning and experimentation while providing commercial terms for production deployments.

## Open Source Licence (Non-Commercial / Educational Use)

- **Who can use it:** Individuals, academic institutions, open source contributors, and organizations using TrustWeave strictly for non-commercial research, prototyping, or educational purposes.
- **Rights granted:** Source code access, modification, and redistribution under the open source terms bundled with the repository (see `LICENSE`).
- **Restrictions:** Commercial usage (including internal production systems that support revenue-generating activities) is not covered by the open source grant.

When in doubt, reach out to Geoknoesis to clarify whether your use case qualifies as non-commercial.

## Geoknoesis Commercial Licence

- **Who needs it:** Any company or organization running TrustWeave in production, embedding it in SaaS offerings, or providing commercial services built on top of TrustWeave.
- **Benefits:** Commercial licence agreements include enterprise support, roadmap collaboration, and optional customizations tailored to your deployment needs.
- **How to obtain:** Contact the Geoknoesis team via [www.geoknoesis.com](https://www.geoknoesis.com) or email `contact@geoknoesis.com` to discuss licensing tiers and support packages.
