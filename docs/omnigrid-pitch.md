# OmniGrid
## Universal Trust Infrastructure for the Spatial Web

---

### The Vision

**OmniGrid** unifies spatial data, Earth Observation systems, and verifiable credentials into a single, interoperable trust grid. Built on TrustWeave's agnostic architecture, OmniGrid enables verifiable trust across any spatial domain, blockchain network, or data provider—without vendor lock-in.

### The Problem

Today's spatial ecosystems are fragmented: data silos (ESA, Planet, NASA, NOAA use proprietary formats), trust gaps (no standardized provenance verification), interoperability issues (systems can't communicate across chains), and the oracle problem (automated systems lack trusted data sources). **Result**: Organizations spend millions on custom integrations and face regulatory compliance challenges.

### The Solution

OmniGrid provides a **universal trust layer** that unifies multi-provider EO data with standardized verifiable credentials, anchors to any blockchain (Algorand, Polygon, Ethereum, Base), enables spatial web authorization via DIDs, automates trust verification for instant payouts and compliance, and delivers tamper-proof audit trails for regulatory requirements.

### Market Opportunity

- **$134B** Geospatial analytics market (15.2% CAGR)
- **$29.3B** Parametric insurance market by 2030
- **$15B+** Supply chain verification by 2025
- **88.2% CAGR** Decentralized identity growth

### Key Differentiators

| Traditional | OmniGrid |
|------------|----------|
| Single-provider lock-in | Multi-provider agnostic |
| Chain-specific | Any blockchain |
| Custom integrations | W3C standards |
| Manual verification | Automated proof |
| Proprietary formats | Open standards |

### Use Cases

**Parametric Insurance**: 24-72 hour automated payouts with verifiable EO triggers (SAR flood, heatwave, hurricane)  
**Supply Chain Compliance**: EUDR deforestation verification with multi-source EO evidence  
**Carbon Markets**: Digital MRV preventing double-counting with blockchain-anchored credentials  
**Spatial Web**: DID-based permissions for autonomous systems (drones, vehicles)  
**EO Catalogues**: Tamper-proof data provenance for satellite imagery

### Technology Foundation

Built on **TrustWeave SDK**—the only truly agnostic trust infrastructure. Domain-agnostic, chain-agnostic, DID-method-agnostic (20+ methods), KMS-agnostic, and W3C standards-compliant.

### Business Model

**SaaS Tiers**: Free (prototyping) → Starter $49/mo → Pro $149/mo → Enterprise (custom)  
**Revenue**: Subscriptions, transaction fees, professional services, commercial licensing

### The Ask

**Seeking partners and customers who need**: Multi-provider EO integration, automated trust verification at scale, regulatory compliance with cryptographic proof, spatial web infrastructure for autonomous systems.
