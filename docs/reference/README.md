# Reference

Welcome to TrustWeave's Reference section! This section contains **lookup materials** for quick access to specific information.

## What is Reference Material?

Reference materials are designed for **quick lookup** rather than learning. Use them when you need to:

- Find a specific module or component
- Look up terminology
- Find answers to common questions
- Understand version differences
- Check migration paths

## Available Reference Materials

### Modules

- **[Core Modules](../modules/core-modules.md)** - Complete list of TrustWeave modules, their dependencies, and when to use them

### Glossary

- **[Glossary](../GLOSSARY.md)** - Complete terminology reference with definitions and examples

### FAQ

- **[FAQ](../faq.md)** - Frequently asked questions and answers

### Migration

- **[Migration Guides](../migration/README.md)** - Guides for upgrading between versions

## When to Use Reference vs Concepts

**Use Reference when you:**
- Need to look up a specific term or definition

- Need answers to common questions
- Are checking version compatibility

**Use Concepts when you:**
- Want to understand why something exists
