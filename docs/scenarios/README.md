    import org.trustweave.trust.types.getOrThrow
    
    val issuerDid = trustWeave.createDid { method(KEY) }.getOrThrowDid()
    val holderDid = trustWeave.createDid { method(KEY) }.getOrThrowDid()

    // 3. Issue Credential
    val credential = trustWeave.issue {
        credential {
            issuer(issuerDid)
            subject { id(holderDid) }
            issued(Instant.now())
