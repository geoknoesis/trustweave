# Tutorials

The tutorials in this section walk through complete VeriCore workflows, showing how typed options, DSLs, and Result-based responses fit together in runnable Kotlin.

## Available Tutorials

- [Wallet API Tutorial](wallet-api-tutorial.md) — build a holder wallet, mint keys, issue credentials, and verify presentations using the in-memory testkit.

More advanced tracks (DID operations, issuance pipelines, trust-layer orchestration) are on the roadmap. If you have a scenario that should be documented next, open an issue or follow the contribution steps in the [Contributing Guide](../contributing/README.md).

## Prerequisites

Before diving in:

- Install VeriCore by following the [installation guide](../getting-started/installation.md).
- Be comfortable with Kotlin coroutines and the `Result`-returning facade APIs.
- Review the [getting started scenarios](../getting-started/README.md) so the option builders and DSL patterns feel familiar.

## Getting Started

Begin with the wallet tutorial above. Each code block now highlights **What it does**, **Result**, and **Design significance**, helping you map the API decisions back to production requirements.

## Next Steps

After you finish the tutorial:

- Deepen your verification strategy with the [Verification Policies](../advanced/verification-policies.md) guide.
- Consult the [API reference](../api-reference/README.md) for parameter-by-parameter details.
- Explore industry workflows in the [scenario playbook](../getting-started/README.md) to see how the same primitives adapt to different domains.
