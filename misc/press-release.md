Geoknoesis Launches VeriCore Open Source to Power the Web of Trust

LEESBURG, VA — November 11, 2025 — Geoknoesis today launched VeriCore as an open-source foundation for the web of trust, making its core trust services freely available for non-profit, non-commercial, and educational use. As the first cornerstone of the Geoknoesis vision, VeriCore delivers a modular trust layer that lets organizations, developers, and municipalities verify the authenticity, provenance, and integrity of digital and spatial interactions in real time.

By releasing VeriCore under an open-source license, Geoknoesis aims to accelerate adoption of open standards—including Verifiable Credentials (VC), Decentralized Identifiers (DID), and emerging interoperability profiles—so that trust signals can flow seamlessly across the modern web. The open-source toolkit gives public institutions, research labs, civic innovators, and academic programs the ability to prototype and deploy trust services without licensing barriers, helping cultivate a standards-aligned ecosystem from the ground up.

“Opening VeriCore to the community is the fastest path to a resilient web of trust,” said Stephane Fellah, CEO of Geoknoesis. “We invite educators, non-profits, and civic technologists to build with us. Their experiments and deployments will guide the next wave of open standards and ensure that trust infrastructure remains transparent, verifiable, and accountable to the public.”

VeriCore’s open-source release highlights four core capabilities drawn directly from the toolkit:

- Decentralized Identifier Services: Pluggable DID methods, registries, and W3C-compliant document management for resolving trustable identities across ecosystems.
- Verifiable Credential Pipeline: Canonicalization, issuance, and verification services that keep credential lifecycles portable and standards-aligned.
- Blockchain Anchoring: Chain-agnostic anchoring interfaces (including CAIP-2 identifiers) that notarize credential digests on Algorand, Polygon, and other ledgers.
- Trust Registry & Delegation: Built-in trust graph discovery, scoring, and delegation checks that connect verifiers to trusted issuers and policies.

Early pilots already showcase VeriCore in smart city infrastructure, logistics, and immersive media. Partners are orchestrating autonomous fleets, authenticating augmented reality overlays, and validating supply-chain telemetry with the toolkit. Its modular design enables incremental adoption, so teams can embed trust services without disrupting current operations.

Looking ahead, Geoknoesis will extend VeriCore with a managed SaaS platform tailored for enterprises that need to orchestrate the web of trust at scale. The forthcoming service will deliver turnkey governance, advanced analytics, and enterprise-grade SLAs—letting global organizations adopt the same open standards while relying on Geoknoesis to handle orchestration, compliance, and lifecycle management.

“The web of trust will only succeed if everyone—from public institutions to Fortune 100 enterprises—can speak a common language for verification,” Fellah added. “Open-sourcing VeriCore jump-starts that collaboration, and our upcoming SaaS platform will give enterprises the operational muscle to run these standards in production.”

The VeriCore open-source repository, documentation, and community resources are available today at www.geoknoesis.com/vericore. Developers, educators, and civic innovators are invited to contribute, provide feedback, and shape the roadmap. Enterprise teams can join the waitlist for the SaaS platform launching in early 2026.
